# How to Run the Project

This project requires **Python** to run because it uses Flask (a Python framework) for the backend logic and database.

## Step 1: Install Python (If you haven't)
1.  Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2.  Download the latest version for Windows.
3.  **IMPORTANT:** When installing, check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"**. This is crucial.

## Step 2: Run the App
I have created a magic file for you called `run_app.bat`.

1.  Open the folder `sql lite` on your desktop.
2.  Double-click the file named `run_app.bat`.
3.  A black screen (terminal) will open and install everything automatically.
4.  Once it says "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000", open that link in your browser.

## Login Details
